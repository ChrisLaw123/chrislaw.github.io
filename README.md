# Personal Website Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal website portfolio, where I showcase projects, interests, and ongoing work as a Computer Engineering student @UWaterloo.

**Live site:** https://chrislaw123.github.io/chrislaw.github.io/

The site highlights a mix of academic and personal projects, along with information about my technical interests and development experience. It also serves as a space for me to experiment with web design and gradually expand my portfolio over time.
